# Spatial microdata in agent-based models {#ABM}

This Chapter is work in progress.

```{r, echo=FALSE}
# In some ways, we can see spatial microsimulation as a precursor to, or early
# form of, agent-based models (ABMs). Agent-based modelling depends on 1) a number
# of discrete agents, 2) with different characteristics, 3) interacting. With the
# spatial microsimulation model created in the last chapter we have 2 of these 3
# elements of an ABMs: if your aim is to use spatial microdata as an input into
# agent based models, you're half way there!
# 
# We do not have space in this tutorial to describe the transition from the
# spatial microdata we have generated into a full ABM. Suffice to mention some of
# the tools that will be useful for the job.
# 
# NetLogo is an mature and widely used toolkit for agent-based models written in
# Java.  The recently published **RNetLogo** package provides an interface between
# R and NetLogo, allowing for model runs to be set-up and run directly from within
# R ([Thiele, 2014](http://www.jstatsoft.org/v58/i02/paper)). Because much of the
# time taken for agent based modelling is focussed on analysis, running NetLogo
# from within R, where the results can be saved, is an eminently sensible choice.
# 
# Watch this space for more on this!
