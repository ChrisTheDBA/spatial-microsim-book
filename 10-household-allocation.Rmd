# Allocating individuals to households

So far the book has explored data on 2 levels: the individual level and
the level of administrative zones. The household is another
fundamental building block of human organisation around which key decision-making,
economic and data-collecting activities are centred.

This chapter explains how to take spatial microdata, of the type
we have generated in the previous chapters, and allocate the resulting
individuals into household units.
