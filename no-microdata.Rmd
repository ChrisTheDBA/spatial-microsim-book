# Population synthesis without microdata {#nomicrodata}

Sometimes no representative individual-level
dataset is available. 
In this case, the methods of population synthesis described in the previous
chapters must be adapted accordingly.
The challenge
is still to generate spatial microdata 
that fits all the constraint tables, but based on purely synthetic
'seed' input microdata. Many
combinations of individual-level data
could correspond to these distributions. Depending on the aim
of the spatial microsimulation model, simply finding a reasonable fit
can be sufficient.

In other cases a fit based on *entropy maximisation* may be required.
This concept involves finding the population that best
represents the most micro-level populations (Bierlaire, 1991).
For example, if a person in one zone has exactly the same charcteristics as
a person in another zone, swapping these two people will not change 
the synthetic population.
This process of maximising the entropy is considered in the subsequent chapter, which
explainings how to 
allocate individuals from the spatial microdata into households to fit
household-level constraints. We will here present
two alternative options for population synthesis when
real individual-level or aggregate-level data is unavailable.

### Global cross-tables and local marginal distributions

Assume we have whole contingency table of variable cross-tabulations in the 
aggregated-level data. Note that this cross-table could be the result of a 
previous step. For example, an IPFP algorithm can be executed to join
data from different form in this high level of aggregation.

For the spatial zones needed, if the marginal distributions are known, 
we can use the **mipfp** function as previously shown. However, if
the only information about the zones is the total population living
there, the function is unusable. In this specific case, having 
no additional data, the single possibility is to 
rescale the global cross-table for each zone. Note that this
implicitly
implies stating the correlations between the variables
as independent of the zone. 

To illustrate, we will develop the SimpleWorld example with 
adapted constraints. When watching the available data in an aggregated level, 
we have for the moment:

```{r,echo=FALSE, message=FALSE}
source("R/SimpleWorld.R")
```

```{r}
# Cross-tabulation of individual-level dataset
table(ind$age, ind$sex)

(total_pop <- rowSums(con_sex)) # total population of each zone
```

To illustrate this section, the local constraint will be the total number
of people in each zone (last column of `consTot`). The global constraint
is a matrix of the form of the cross-table between age and sex, but 
including the total population (33 people for SimpleWorld). The new 
constraints could be :

```{r}
# Global Constraint possible for SimpleWorld
global_cons <- table(ind$age, ind$sex)
global_cons[1,] <- c(6,9)
global_cons[2,] <- c(7,11)

# Local Constraint for SimpleWorld
local_cons <- total_pop
```

When having only these aggregate-level data, the best way to 
reach a synthetic population is to rescale the cross-table.
For each zone, a table proportional to the global one is created.
The results are stored in a three dimensional array, which first
dimension represents the zone. The initialisation of the resulting
matrix is the first step. We here fill in the table with "0".


```{r}
# initialise result's array and its names
resNames <- list(1:nrow(cons), rownames(global_cons), 
            colnames(global_cons))
res <- array(0, dim=c(nrow(cons), dim(global_cons)), 
             dimnames=resNames)
```

Now the final weight table is calculated, simply by 
taking the global matrix and rescale it to fit the 
the wanted marginals. Like this, we keep the global
proportions, but with the correct total per zone.
Note that making this process is exactly the same as 
running `mipfp` on the seed table with as constraints
only the zone marginals.

```{r}
# re-scale the cross-table to fit the zone's constraints
# loop on the zones
for (zone in 1:length(total_pop)){
  res[zone,,] <- global_cons*total_pop[zone]/sum(global_cons)
}

# printing the cross-table for zone 1
res[1,,]
```

We can verify that the total population
per zone is of the desired size. We can also 
check the global table of age and sex. 
This means that we have now weights fitting
well all available data.

```{r}
# checking the local constraints for each zone
# (Good if all TRUE)
for (zone in 1:length(total_pop)){
 print( sum(round(res[zone,,])) == total_pop[zone] )
}

# saving the global final table
SimTot <- apply(res,c(2,3),sum)

# checking the global constraint 
# (Good if 0)
sum(SimTot - global_cons)
```


As with IPF, the fractional result needs to be integerised to create
spatial microdata. The `round()` function gives a satisfying result in this case, in terms
of fitting the constraints. However, the aforementioned integerisation algorithms such as
*truncate, replicate, sample* (TRS) can also be used.
This method can not be followed exactly, because we want to perfectly fit 
the few constraints we have. In our example, a satisfactory result is acheived by using 
the round function, as shown in the code below.


```{r}
# Integerisation by simply using round
resRound <- round(res)

# Error by rounding for global constraint
apply(resRound,c(2,3),sum) - global_cons

# Error by rounding for local constraint
apply(resRound,c(1),sum) - local_cons
```

We are very lucky that `round` works. Indeed, in most 
of cases, you will then have some errors. For example, 
if a zone has 4 individuals and three categories, there
is a possibility to have the weights 
$(\frac{4}{3},\frac{4}{3},\frac{4}{3})$. Then, 
the rounding gives $(1,1,1)$ and one individual 
is missing after this process.
To adapt the method to use TRS, the first stage is to 
truncate the data and identify the missing individuals.

```{r}
# Integerisation by adapting TRS

# truncate the data 
resTruncate <- floor(res)

# number of missing individuals
sum(total_pop) - sum(resTruncate)
```

This means 4 individuals are missing
after we have truncated. We need to 
observe in which category and in which zone 
we have to add individuals.

```{r}
# Calculate the total simulated cross-table
SimTotTruncate <- apply(resTruncate,c(2,3),sum)

# number of missing individuals per category
ToAdd <- global_cons - SimTotTruncate
ToAdd

# number of missing individuals per zone
ToComplete <- local_cons - apply(resTruncate,c(1),sum)
ToComplete
```

The principle is to add people in the not completed zones and
categories. The cells to be implemented are always chosen as the one
with the bigger decimal parts. Remark that we chose
to adapt the `resTruncate` instead of defining
another tabular.

```{r}
# Calculate the decimals left by truncate
decimals <- res - resTruncate

# Adapting resTruncate to fit all constraints
while (sum(total_pop) - sum(resTruncate) > 0){
  # find the biggest decimals
  i <- which( decimals == max(decimals), arr.ind = TRUE)

  # remember we already considered this cell
  decimals[i] <- 0

  # if this zone still miss individuals
  if (ToComplete[i[1]] > 0){
    # if this category still miss individuals
    if (ToAdd[i[2],i[3]] > 0){
      resTruncate[i] <- resTruncate[i] + 1
      ToComplete[i[1]] <- ToComplete[i[1]] - 1
      ToAdd[i[2],i[3]] <- ToAdd[i[2],i[3]] - 1
    }
  }
}
```

The new values in `resTruncate` follow all constraints. 
The adaptation of TRS could be avoid by making a combinatorial
optimization to decide in which zone and category
we add individuals. However, the TRS is more 
intuitive.

### Two-level aggregated data 

We present here how to find a possible distribution per zone when 
having only aggregated data, but in two different levels of aggregation.
For example, we have some data for the municipalities and other for
the districts. A first proposition can be to use a genetic algorithm that 
minimise the distance between the constraint and the simulation.
The solution proposed by BarthÃ©lemy and Toint (2013) is intuitive and we 
develop here the method. In such cases, they propose to generate 
a 'seed' before to execute IPF. 

In their case, they wanted to simulate a population with four characteristics
per individual : the gender, the age class, the diploma level and the
activity status and at the municipality level. Their available
data was: 

1. At municipality level: the cross table gender x age and the marginals of diploma level and activity status;
2. At district level: the cross tables gender x activity status, gender x diploma level, age x activity status and age x diploma level.

Note that a district contains several municipalities, but 
each municipality is associated to only one district. 
We consider the marginals of the tables being consistent. If not, 
a preliminary step is necessary to rescale the data 
to avoid shifting to probabilities.

The global idea of their method is to proceed in two steps. 
First, they simulate the cross table  of the 
four variables per district. Then, this table is considered
as the seed of the IPF algorithm to
simulate the distributions per municipality. During
this second stage, the data concerning the municipality 
are used as constraints. How to execute the second part 
has been explained in the first section of this chapter. 
The point here is to develop the process, per district, 
to simulate the four dimensional cross table, 
with the available data. This is also done in two steps :

1. Generate Age x gender x diploma level and Age x gender x professional status;
2. Generate Age x gender x diploma level x professional status.

For the first step, we will explain only the 
creation of the first cross table, since the second
reasoning is similar. The idea is simply to proceed 
proportionally to respect both available table.
The pseudo-code below corresponds to the code 
done by BarthÃ©lemy and Toint (2013).

For the clarity of the formal formula, we rename
gender (A), age (B) and diploma level (C). To create
the cross table of these three variables, 
we have at the district level the cross tables
gender x diploma level (renamed AC) and 
age x diploma level (renamed BC). Then, 
the cells of the 3 dimensional
table is defined for each gender $g$,
age $a$ and diploma level $d$ as followed :

$$ABC(g,a,d)=\frac{AC(g,d)}{margin(d)}BC(a,d)$$

The formula is intuitive. The fraction gives the proportion 
of each gender inside the considered
category of diploma level. Then, this proportion splits 
the number of persons having characteristics b and c
into the category of a. 
For example, in the specific case of defining 
(Male, Young, Academics), we will have :

$$ABC(Male, Young, Aca)=\frac{AC(Male,Aca)}{\#Aca}BC(Young,Aca)$$

Suppose, we have 50 young academics out of 
150 academics (90 female and 60 male). We would have:

$$ABC(Male, Young, Aca)=\frac{60}{150}*50=20$$
$$ABC(Female, Young, Aca)=\frac{90}{150}*50=30$$

Thus, the tables Age x gender x diploma level
and Age x gender x professional status are simulated. 
The seed for the IPF function can now be
established, with help of the two contingencies. 
These initial weights will be the distribution 
inside the whole district.
