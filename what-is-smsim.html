          <h1 id="what-is">What is spatial microsimulation?</h1>
<p>Spatial microsimulation is a statistical technique for allocating individuals from a survey dataset to administrative zones, based on shared variables between the areal and individual level data. As with many new and infrequently used phrases, this understanding is not shared by everyone. The meaning of spatial microsimulation varies depending on context and who you ask. To an economist, spatial microsimulation is likely to imply modelling some kind of temporal process such as how individual agents in different areas respond to changes in prices or policies. To a transport planner, the term may imply simulating the precise movements of vehicles on the transport network. To your next door neighbour it may mean you have started speaking gobbledygook! Hence the need to consider what spatial microsimulation is, and what it is not, at the outset.</p>
<h2 id="terminology">Terminology</h2>
<p>Delving a little into the etymology and history of the term reveals the reasons behind this duplicity of meaning and highlights the importance of terminology. Rarely will you be understood saying “I use <em>spatial microsimulation</em>” in everyday life. Usually it is important to add context. Below are a few hypothetical situations and suggested responses.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>When talking to a colleague, a transport modeller: “spatial microsimulation, also known as population synthesis…”</p></li>
<li><p>Speaking to agent based modellers: “we use spatial microsimulation to simulate the characteristics of geo-referenced agents…”</p></li>
<li><p>Communicating with undergraduates who are unlikely to have come across the term or its analogies. “I do spatial microsimulation, a way of generating individual-level data for small areas…”</p></li>
<li><p>Chatting casually in the pub or coffee shop: “I’m using a technique called spatial microsimulation to model people…”.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The above examples illustrate potential for confusion: care needs to be taken to use terminology each audience understands. The transport modeller, for example, may already know that the term ‘population synthesis’ means creating an individual-level dataset of real areas, whereas more basic terms need to be used when communicating the method to policy makers. All this links back to the importance of transparency and reproducibility of method discussed in the previous chapter: avoid implying spatial microsimulation is something it is not.</p>
<p>Faced with uncomprehending stares when describing the method, some may be tempted to ‘blind them with science’, relying on sophisticated-sounding jargon, for example by saying: “we use simulated annealing in our integerised spatial microsimulation model”. Such wording obscures meaning (how many people in the room will understand ‘integerised’, let alone ‘simulated annealing’) and makes the process inaccessible. Although much jargon is used in the spatial microsimulation literature and in this book, care must be taken to ensure that people understand what you are saying.</p>
<p>This raises the question, why use the term spatial microsimulation at all, if it is understood by so few people? The answer to this is that spatial microsimulation, defined clearly at the outset and used correctly, can concisely describe a technique that would otherwise need many more words on each use. Try replacing ‘spatial microsimulation’ with ‘a statistical technique to allocate individuals from a survey dataset to administrative zones’ each time it appears in this book and the advantages of a simple term should become clear! ‘Population synthesis’ is perhaps a more accurate term but, transport modelling aside, the literature already uses ‘spatial microsimulation’. Rather than create more complexity with <em>another</em> piece of jargon, we proceed with the term favoured by the majority of practitioners.</p>
<p>Why has this situation, in which practitioners of a statistical method must tread carefully to avoid confusing their audience, come about? First it’s worth stating that the problem is by no means unique to this field: imagine the difficulties that Bayesian statisticians must encounter when speaking of prior and posterior probability distributions to an uninitiated audience. Let alone describing Gibb’s sampling.</p>
<p>To avoid confusion regarding the terminology used in this book, a glossary defining much of the jargon relating to spatial microsimulation is provided at the end. For now, to help answer what spatial microsimulation is we will look at its applications and then at what it is not.</p>
<h2 id="applications">Applications</h2>
<p>Spatial microsimulation has a wide variety of applications and there are many areas where the technique has been used. Some of the main areas of application have been health, economic policy evaluation and transport. Rather than attempt to provide a comprehensive account of the range of current and possible applications, this section describes a single study in each area to exemplify how spatial microsimulation is used.</p>
<h3>Health applications</h3>
<p>An excellent example of the potential practical utility of spatial microsimulation is a study which estimated the rate of smoking at the small area level in the city of Leeds UK (Tomintz et al. 2008). Smoking is a classic ‘target variable’ in spatial microsimulation: it is reported in a number of individual-level surveys but there is surprisingly little information about how smoking rates vary from place to place. Thus it is difficult to where to locate services that depend on the rate of smoking. The synthetic spatial microdata could thus be used to help identify new clinics to help people stop smoking. (Alternatively, the spatial microdata could be used by a tobacco chain to help decide where to invest in a new shop, highlighting the potential misuse of the technique by unscrupulous analysts.) The authors found that actual anti-smoking clinics were not located optimally. Furthermore, the results pointed to optimal locations for new clinics, potentially improving the cost-effectiveness of public health campaigns.</p>
<p>This research has since been ‘scaled-up’ to estimate smoking rates across the whole of Austria. The <a href="http://www.simsalud.org/">simSALUD</a> portal provides users with access to the resulting spatial microdata and an on-line interface to allow for the selection of constraint variables and other options to customise the model for the specific purposes. This portal-based system and the provision of synthetic spatial microdata to researchers illustrates one possible direction that spatial microsimulation research could go in, where the synthetic data produced from a large model is the main output of the research, to be used by others for a variety of applications.</p>
<p>The example of smoking demonstrates the increase spatial resolution that spatial microsimulation can bring to bear on under-studied areas in public health. Where the prevalence of unhealthy activities is closely related to socio-demographic variables, a synthetic microdataset can lead to decision making tools that would be difficult to implement with non-spatial surveys alone. <strong>Simobesity</strong> is another research project and spatial microsimulation software tool that estimates the prevalence of obesity at the local levels depending on demographic constraint variables (Edwards and Clarke, 2013) . Recent evidence has emerged on the impact of car-dependent urban environments on inactive lifestyles and resulting poor health (these areas have been labelled ‘obesogenic’). In this context, there is great potential for combining socio-demographic and environmental-geographic variables in a spatial microsimulation model. Using the same principles described in Tomintz et al. (2008), the outputs of such a model could help target local interventions to tackle physical inactivity, to maximise the benefits of public health funds.</p>
<h3>Economic policy evaluation</h3>
<p>Microsimulation was originally developed for economic policy evaluation and it<br />is still one of most common applications. ‘Social impact evaluation’, where the impact of policy changes on different income and socio-demographic groups is explored, is a classic example of applied microsimulation research. Frequently these simulations are undertaken by governmental departments for entire countries and focus on overall shifts in the population rather than spatial variability in the impacts. The EU funded EUROMOD project and software package of the same name is is the largest of these initiatives. The EUROMOD software is used by government analysts and research agencies in many countries to estimate the distributional impacts of policy reforms. In a recent example, EUROMOD was used to assess effects of austerity on different income groups in the UK (De Agostini et al. 2014). The finding that recent policies have been highly regressive (Figure 2.1) shows that microsimulation can provide a new evidence base in policy relevant areas.</p>

<p>Spatial microsimulation uses very similar techniques as those employed by EUROMOD and other economic microsimulation models, including probability-weighted random sampling of individual-level data and aggregate-level scenario development (Sutherland and Figari, 2013). The majority of microsimulation research for economic policy evaluation does not disagreggate the impacts over space, however. The estimation of variability at the <em>local level</em> is what differentiates spatial microsimulation models from economic microsimulation models, although the underlying methods are very similar.</p>
<h3>Transport</h3>
<p>Transport modelling is a mature field that increasingly uses individual-level data as the basis of analysis. Large scale models such as <a href="http://www.matsim.org/">MATSim</a> rely on spatial microdata to provide demand for travel and individual characteristics for origins and destinations. Although the techniques for generating spatial microdata in transport are the same in transport, the process is referred to as <em>population synthesis</em>.</p>
<p>Generally, little attention is paid to this process of synthetic population generation in transport modelling because the focus is on movement of individuals rather than their characteristics. Distributional impacts are often overlooked in transport models (Lucas 2012) and there is much potential to integrate spatial microsimulation with existing transport modelling methods.</p>
<p>An example of the potential uses of spatial microsimulation in transport models is illustrated in Figure 2.2. This shows the simulated commuting behaviour of 20 randomly selected individuals from a large scale spatial microdataset of Sheffield. Because the constraints used in this model included socio-demographic variables, each individual represented in the figure has a rich profile of characteristics associated with them. This analysis can provide new evidence about the likely winners and loosers from very specific interventions such as a new bicycle path or bus route (Lovelace et al. 2014). As a result of the increased detail allowed by such methods there is much interest in spatial microsimulation for transport applications. Figure 2.2 also illustrates the potential for the output of spatial microsimulation to be used as an input into agent-based models (ABM).</p>

<h2 id="is-not">What spatial microsimulation is not</h2>
<p><strong>Spatial microsimulation is not strictly spatial</strong></p>
<p>The most surprising feature of spatial microsimulation is that the method is not strictly <em>spatial</em>. The only reason why the method has developed this name (as opposed to ‘small area population synthesis’, for example) is that practitioners tend to use administrative zones, which represent geographical areas, as the grouping variable. However, any mutually exclusive grouping variable, such as age band or number of bedrooms in your house, could be used. Likewise, geographical location can be used as a <em>constraint variable</em>. In most spatial microsimulation models, the spatial variable is a mutually exclusive grouping, interchangeable with any such group. Of course, the spatial microdata, maps and analysis that result from spatial microsimulation are spatial, it’s just that there is nothing inherently spatial about the method used to generate the spatial microdata.</p>
<p>To be more precise, spatial microsimulation is not <em>inherently spatial</em>. Spatial attributes such as the geographic coordinates of the zones to which individuals have been allocated and home and work locations can easily be added to the spatial microdata after they have been generated. It is the use of geographical variables as the grouping variable that is critical here and which distinguishes spatial microsimulation from other types of microsimulation.</p>
<p><strong>Spatial microsimulation is not agent-based modelling (ABM).</strong></p>
<p>Spatial microsimulation does involve the creation and analysis of individuals, but it does not imply any interaction between these individuals. For this, an agent-based model (ABM) is needed. It would be easy to assume that because the method contains the word ‘simulation’, it includes modelling of individual behaviours over time and space. This is not the case.</p>
<p>Spatial microsimulation as an approach to modelling involves what-if scenarios, the allocation of individuals to specific zones and, in some cases, a time step to represent the individuals’ evolution over time. Agent based modelling, by contrast imply some kind of interaction between the individual units. Spatial microsimulation is closely linked to ABM, however. As described in Chapter , the outputs of spatial microsimulation form an excellent basis for ABMs.</p>
<p><strong>Spatial microsimulation does not generate new data</strong></p>
<p>During spatial microsimulation, apparently new individuals are created and placed into zones. It would be tempting to think that new information about the world is somehow being created. This is not the case: the ‘new’ individuals are simply repeats of individuals we already knew about from the individual-level data, albeit in a different order and in different combinations. If the population of the study area is greater than the sample size of the input data, many individuals will have to be ‘cloned’. Thus we are not increasing the diversity of the dataset, simply changing its aggregate-level characteristics.</p>
<h2 id="assumptions">Assumptions</h2>
<p>As with any simulation technique, spatial microsimulation is based on assumptions, some of which are unlikely to hold in all cases. This does not preclude spatial microsimulation in cases where the assumptions do not hold: “It is far better to foresee even without certainty than not to foresee at all”, as Henri Poincaré put it (Barthélemy 2014).</p>
<p>It is vital, however, that users of spatial microsimulation and ‘consumers’ of the resulting research understand that the results of spatial microsimulation are not <em>real</em> but a best estimate of the population in a given area. The danger is that if the assumptions are not understood, incorrect conclusions will result. It is therefore the duty of researchers using spatial microsimulation (and other techniques) to clearly state the assumptions on which the results depend on and the extent to which these assumptions can be expected to hold in practice. Roughly speaking there are four main assumptions underlying all spatial microsimulation models:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>The individual-level microdata are representative of the study area.</li>
<li>The target variable is dependent on the constraint variables and their interactions in a way that is relatively constant over space and time.</li>
<li>The relationships between the constraint variables are not spatially dependent.</li>
<li>The input microdataset and constraints are sufficiently rich and detailed to reproduce the full diversity of individuals and areas in the study region.</li>
</ol>
<p>Obviously the real world is complex and many processes are spatially dependent, invalidating assumptions 2 and 3. The extent to which the relationships between variables can be deemed to be constant over space is often unknown. However, there there are ways of checking the spatial dependency of relationships between multiply variables, not least Geographically Weighted Regression (GWR).</p>
<p>These limitations should be discussed at the outset of spatial microsimulation research, with reference to the input data. To see how spatial microsimulation simplifies the real world, the next chapter describes a hypothetical scenario where 33 inhabitants of an imaginary land are simulated and allocated to three zones based on a microdataset of only 5 individuals and two constraint variables.</p>
