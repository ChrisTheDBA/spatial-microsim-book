## Spatial Microsimulation with R

Aims:

1. To provide a solid understanding of the method and applications
2. To teach its implementation in R in general terms
3. To provide guidance on next steps

## Objectives:

- Become proficient with R and RStudio for handling data
- Understand some applications where spatial microsimulation is useful
- Realise the limitations of the method
- Know about a range of packages for doing spatial microsimulation with R
- Understand code for generating spatial microdata with **mipfp**
- Have ideas for trying the methods on your own datasets

# About the course and its teachers

## The request to teach at the EU

- Links with much of the research taking place at the JRC
- Big Data
- Modelling
- Social impact assessment
- Scenarios of the future

## The course materials

- Based on our book - digital versions available on-line
- Slides available on-line
- We'll be making small 'code chunks' and scripts available during the course
- Any feedback welcome

# What is spatial microsimulation and its applications

## What is spatial microsimulation?

1. A method
2. An approach

## Applications

- Wide variety of potential applications
- So far main applications have been in health, poverty mapping and transport
- What do you want to use spatial microsimulation for?
