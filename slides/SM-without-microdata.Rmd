## Without microdata?

If you have no microdata, but you would like to generate a microsimulation, you can use a wide range of methods, depending on the data you have.

For example:

> - Global cross-tables and local marginal distributions 

> - Two level aggregated data 

> - Only a cross-table, but also mean, standard deviation,... of the caracteristics you would like to add

## Global cross-tables and local marginal distributions 

The global cross-table can be the initial weight matrix.

## Two level aggregated data 

For example (BarthÃ©lemy and Toint - 2013): 

At municipality level: 

>  - the cross table gender x age 
>  - and the marginals of diploma level and activity status;
          
          
          
At district level: 

>  - gender x activity status, 
>  - gender x diploma level, 
>  - age x activity status 
>  - and age x diploma level.

## Several steps

> 1. Create at district level gender x activity status x age 
> 2. Create at district level gender x diploma level x age 
> 3. Create at district level gender x activity status x age x diploma level
> 4. Use this data as seed for IPF and the two municipality level databases as constraints

## Coding

Imagine that the aim is to create a population for a Belgian province (Namur) characterised by: 

> - A municipality (code INS),
> - a diploma level,
> - a professional status level,
> - an age category (0.5 meaning from 0 to 5 years old),
> - a gender.

##
The data you have are stored in the *Belgium* folder. You have : 

> - ContrainteStatut.txt: per municipality and professional status, you have a count;
> - ContrainteGenre.txt: per municipality and gender, you have a count;
> - ContrainteDipl.txt: per municipality and diploma level, you have a count;
> - ContrainteAge.txt: per municipality and age classes, you have a count;
> - BelgiqueConting.txt : per age classes, gender, diploma and status, you have a count.
