\chapter*{Preface}

Spatial microsimulation is a set of methods for modelling individuals who
reside geographical space, such as people living in a city.
This book is for anyone who wants to not only understand
but to \emph{use} spatial microsimulation, for applied or academic work.
The emphasis is therefore practical rather than theoretical.
New R packages for easing spatial microsimulation are described in
detail, with reference to practical examples and reproducible code.
The aim is to enable you to implement the methods on your own
datasets. 
% and are best understood with
% reference to my own experience of trying to learn spatial microsimulation.

% Like many PhD students
% and researchers, I was tasked with implementing a method that
% was almost completely new to me.
% I had barely heard of Spatial Microsimulation,
% let alone understood the methodology.
% The first stage was to read up on what spatial microsimulation
% actually was: in this area I had good guidance from my
% supervisor, Dimitris Ballas, who pointed me towards an accessible introduction
% to the subject commissioned by the Joseph Roundtree Foundation
% (Ballas, 2005).
% This text explained clearly what spatial microsimulation
% was, but not how to implement it --- that I had to learn,
% from scratch.

The motivations for writing this book go back to my own research.
I was tasked with creating a spatial microsimulation model of transport energy use but struggled to get the project off the ground.
Much literature mentioned the method but nothing I could find
described \emph{how} to do spatial microsimulation
using a modern programming language.
% A breakthrough came when I requested to see some of the
% R code used by Malcolm Campbell, who had
% recently completed a PhD using
% spatial microsimulation to explore health inequalities
% in Scotland.
% Malcolm's code proved invaluable, providing a basis
% on which I could write my own model.
It was only when a colleague, Malcolm Campbell, shared some of his
R code with me that I started making real progress. The experience
of code sharing demonstrated the importance of
reproducible research and `open science', raising the question:
why there was no practical material on spatial microsimulation?

% The number of
% hours spent dubugging and cursing the code would have been
% greatly reduced if I had had a reference text on the subject.
% This is the book I wish I'd had.
% The trigger that turned these ideas into a concrete book proposal was
% a two day course,
% An Introduction to Spatial Microsimulation with R,
% held at the University
% of Leeds in the spring of 2014.
The opportunity to turn these thoughts into reality came in the spring
of 2014, when I was asked to run a practical course on the topic at
the University of Leeds.
The high demand before the course
and positive feedback from participants
demonstrated that there was a concrete need for new, practical teaching materials.
% , it seemed there was a
% definite need for more practical teaching material on spatial microsimulation
% than was available at the time: many people had read the literature and had
% a good idea about the problem that they wanted to use the method to solve.
% Yet the majority were dissatisfied with the practical content of existing
% work, or lack thereof.

Four months later, on the 18$^{th}$ to 19$^{th}$ of September 2014,
I delivered another 2 day course on spatial microsimulation
at the University of Cambridge, UK.
The course materials had been greatly updated
and it was apparent that there was demand for more.
The book plan was born.

Morgane Dumont was a keen attendee on the Cambridge course, who
maintained a keen interest in the associated teaching materials.
Morganes's background in Mathematics and Statistics makes her the
ideal co-author, complementing the my own focus on practical examples
and code.

 % has contributed greatly to the book, including material on the core topics of the mipfp package and household allocation.

% In summary, this is the book I wish I had during my PhD and
% it should be of use to a wide range of researchers and practitioners.
% The practical nature of the content should make the content especially well-suited to educators, for example as part of a module on spatial microsimulation.
% Spatial microsimulation with R is intended to be a clear, succinct and above all useful introduction to the field.

The present book is a
result of this long-standing international teamwork.
\emph{Spatial microsimulation with R} is,
to the best of our knowledge, the only practical book on in the
field available today.
We sincerely hope it is useful in your work.
More widely we also help will provide a
a solid foundation for advancement in the
field and a toolkit for solving real-world problems.

% reproducible using publicly available
% code and data.

% The practical guidance should be applicable to a wide range of problems.

% \section{Acknowledgements}
% 
% As with any worthwhile textbook, this was not a solo effort. I benefited
% immensly from teaching spatial microsimulation to diverse audiences, the
% formal and informal feedback they provided, and correspondence with a number
% of people using spatial microsimulation `in the wild'. Of these,
% the following deserve special mention:
% 
% \begin{itemize}
%   \item James Gleeson, from the Greater London Authority (GLA), provided insight
%   into how spatial microsimulation can be used in local government and made several
%   improvements to the book.
%   \item Ulrike Rauer, from the University of Oxford, commented on
%   early drafts of the book and showed how it could be made more relevant to PhD
%   students new to the approach.
%   \item Stephen Clarke at the University of Leeds demonstrated the benefits of
%   the Flexible Modelling Framework and encouraged testing of the R code on much
%   larger datasets than had previously been used, encouraging optimisation of the code.
% \end{itemize}
% 
% Thanks also to all the people
% who provided the wider resources for this project to happen.


% Another advantage
% I had was Malcolm Campbell as a predecessor.
% Malcolm provided a huge amount of
% support during the early phase of my PhD and shared
% all the R code he developed.
% Not only was this invaluable to my efforts to
% build a spatial microsimulation model in
% R (some of the code in the book is probably his at some level);
% his example of collaboration
% and code sharing was inspirational. It is this generosity,
% displayed every day in the open source software movement,
% that drove my desire to write this book. After all, free
% to produce and communicate, knowledge is the ultimate renewable resource.
