# Additional tools and techniques

This Chapter is work in progress.

```{r, echo=FALSE}
# ## R packages for spatial microsimulation
# 
# All the code chunks presented so far, with the exception of **ggplot2** commands
# run in R's **base** package. This was a deliberate choice for robustness of
# code and minimising installation dependencies over the advantages of using
# more complex packages. There are often dozens of ways of doing one thing
# in R, potentially via a handful of packages. The way that will work
# on the maximum number of machines is often preferable, unless there is a
# clear performance advantage to using additional packages. An additional reason
# to use contributed packages sparingly (excepting the `r-recommended` packages
# endorsed by the R core team --- see http://cran.r-project.org/bin/linux/debian/README
# for details) is that the behaviour of package functions may change unexpectedly,
# whereas core R functions are likely to remain stable over many decades to come.
# 
# With this caveat out of the way, let's begin our tour of the packages of most
# potential use to spatial microsimulation.
# 
# ### **plyr** and **dplyr**
# 
# ### **reshape 2**
# 
# ### **multilevel**
# 
# ### **RNetLogo**

## The Flexible Modelling Framework (FMF)

## Allocation of home-work locations

## A spatial interaction model with individual agents

## Advanced applications in agent-based modelling
