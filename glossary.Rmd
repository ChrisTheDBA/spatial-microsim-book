# **Population base** 
# 
# This term is roughly equivalent to the 'target population',
# used by statisticians to describe the population about whom they wish to
# draw conclusions based on a 'sample population'.
# The sample population, is the group of individuals who
# we have individual-level data for.
# 
# The **population base** is the
# complete set of individuals represented by the aggregate-level data in the
# constraint tables. A common example is the variable "Hours worked":
# only people aged 16 to 74 are generally thought of as working, so, if there is
# no `NA` (no answer) category, the population base is not the same as the total
# population of an area. A common problem faced by people using spatial microsimulation
# methods is incompatibility between aggregate constraints that use different population
# bases.
