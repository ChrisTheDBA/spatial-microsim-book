# Glossary

-   **Algorithm**: a series of computer commands executed in a
    specific order for a pre-defined purpose.
    Algorithms process input data and produce outputs.

-   **Combinatorial optimisation** is an approach to spatial
    microsimulation that generates spatial microdata by randomly
    selecting individuals from a survey dataset and measuring the fit
    between the simulated output and the constraint variables. If the
    fit improves after any particular change, the change is kept.
    Williamson (2007) provides a practical user manual. Harland ()

-   **Data frame**: a type of object (formally referred to as a class)
    in R, data frames are square tables composed of rows and columns of
    information. As with many things in R, the best way to understand
    data frames is to create them and experiment. The following creates
    a data frame with two variables: name and height:

    Note that each new variable is entered using the command `c()` this is
    how R creates objects with the *vector* data class, a one
    dimensional matrix — and that text data must be entered in quote
    marks.

-   **Deterministic reweighting** is an approach to generating spatial
    microdata that allocates fractional weights to individuals based on
    how representative they are of the target area. It differs from
    combinatorial optimisation approaches in that it requires no random
    numbers. The most frequently used method of deterministic
    reweighting is IPF.

-   **For loops** are instructions that tell the computer to run a
    certain set of command repeatedly. `for(i in 1:9) print(i)`, for
    example will print the value of i 9 times. The best way to further
    understand for loops is to try them out.

-   **Iteration**: one instance of a process that is repeated many times
    until a predefined end point, often within an *algorithm*.

-   **Iterative proportional fitting** (IPF): an iterative process
    implemented in mathematics and algorithms to find the maximum
    likelihood of cells that are constrained by multiple sets of
    marginal totals. To make this abstract definition even more
    confusing, there are multiple terms which refer to the process,
    including ‘biproportional fitting’ and ‘matrix raking’. In plain
    English, IPF in the context of spatial microsimulation can be
    defined as *a statistical technique for allocating weights to
    individuals depending on how representative they are of different
    zones*. IPF is a type of deterministic reweighting, meaning that
    random numbers are not needed to generate the result and that the
    output weights are real (not integer) numbers.
    
    The **population base** roughly equivalent to the 'target population',
    used by statisticians to describe the population about whom they wish to
    draw conclusions based on a 'sample population'.
    The sample population, is the group of individuals who
    we have individual-level data for.
    In aggregate-level data, the **population base** is the
    complete set of individuals represented by the counts.
    A common example is the variable "Hours worked":
    only people aged 16 to 74 are generally thought of as working, so, if there is
    no `NA` (no answer) category, the population base is not the same as the total
    population of an area. A common problem faced by people using spatial microsimulation
    methods is incompatibility between aggregate constraints that use different     
    population bases.
    
    **Spatial microsimulation** is the name given to a series of techniques that
    generate, analyse and model individual-level data allocated to small
    administrative zones. Spatial microsimulation is an approach for
    understanding processes that operate on individual and geographical levels.
    
    A **weight matrix** is a 2 dimensional array that links non-spatial
    *microdata* to geographical zones. Each row in the weight matrix represents
    an individual and each column represents a zone. Thus, in R notation,
    the weight matrix `w` has dimensions of `nrow(ind)` rows by `nrow(cons)`
    where `ind` and `cons` are the microdata and constraints respectively.
    The value of `w[i,j]` represents the extent to which individual `i` is
    representative of zone `j`. `sum(w)` is the total population of the study area.
    The weight matrix is an efficient way of storing spatial microdata because
    it does not require a new row for every additional individual in the study
    area. For a weight matrix to be converted into spatial microdata, all the
    values of the wieghts must be integers. The conversion of an integer weight
    matrix into an integer weight matrix is known as *integerisation*.
