Spatial microsimulation allows analysis of multiple levels of data in a single
modelling framework. So far we have used (and generated) data at individual
and geographical levels. The next most important level of human organisation
--- since the decline of the tribe --- is the household (Wheelock and Oughton, 1996).
Households are worth studying as self-standing units because many phenomena,
including where to live, access to resources (financial, intellectual and
physical --- such as cars and bicycles) and friendship networks, operate at this
level. More pragmatically, many surveys and survey questions are conducted at
the household level. Being able to include the resulting data
(e.g. on number of cars per household)
