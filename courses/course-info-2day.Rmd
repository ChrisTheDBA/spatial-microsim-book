- Introduction to spatial microsimulation in R
    - Course overview, aims and objectives (RL)
    - Ask if they have special objectives to reach thanks to this course

- Applications (with an emphasis on EU projects)
    - Agriculture
    - Transport (MD - I can present the Jojo's microsimulation - 30 min)
    

- Using R and RStudio for spatial microsimulation
    - The RStudio Graphical User Interface (GUI)
